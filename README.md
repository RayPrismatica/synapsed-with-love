# Synapsed

> **You've been Synapsed.**

If you're reading this, you probably came across a website that felt... different. Not static. Not stale. **Alive.** Content that changed when you refreshed. Commentary that referenced what's happening *right now*. A site that reads the world and responds.

That's what being Synapsed means.

**Synapsed** is a dynamic content system implemented by [Ray Tarantino](https://github.com/RayPrismatica) for [Prismatica Labs Limited](https://prismaticalab.com). It transforms static websites into living, thinking entities that wake up every morning, read the news you read, and update themselves with commentary in your voice.

## The Vision

We believe **thinking should be infrastructure, not a privilege.**

For decades, keeping content fresh has meant one of three paths:
1. **Hire humans** - Writers, editors, content strategists ($$$)
2. **Use a CMS** - WordPress, Contentful, Sanity (lock-in + monthly fees)
3. **Let it die** - Launch once, watch it slowly fossilize

All three are broken. Humans are expensive. CMSs are cages. Fossil sites repel visitors.

**Synapsed is the fourth path.**

Your website becomes a neural endpoint. Connected to reality. Processing signals. Responding in real-time. Not because you're manually updating it. Because it's **Synapsed** - wired directly into the world's information stream.

## What It Does

On your schedule (every 6 hours, hourly, daily - you choose), Synapsed:

1. **Reads** - Fetches headlines from your chosen news sources (BBC, NYT, TechCrunch, Reuters, etc.)
2. **Thinks** - Sends them to Claude AI with prompts that encode your worldview
3. **Writes** - Generates fresh commentary in your voice
4. **Publishes** - Saves to cache file, site serves fresh content

No database. No CMS. No humans in the loop. Just **synaptic automation** - your thinking, encoded once, firing forever.

## Why It Matters

### For Your Visitors
- Content feels current, not dated
- References what's happening *right now*
- Demonstrates sophistication without screaming about it
- Proves you're paying attention

### For You
- Set once, runs forever
- Cost varies based on update frequency and API usage
- No content calendar, no editorial meetings, no deadlines
- Your site stays fresh while you sleep, travel, build

### The Philosophy

Most websites are **fossils** - beautiful artifacts of the day they launched, slowly decaying.

Dynamic CMSs are **cages** - you trade freedom for convenience, pay monthly to fill their forms.

**Synapsed sites are organisms.** They breathe with the news cycle. They wake up and have something to say. Not because they're magical. Because they're **connected** - one synapse from reality to your homepage.

That's the future. Not websites that need feeding. **Websites that feed themselves.**

## Live Example

See it live: [prismaticalab.com](https://prismaticalab.com)

The opening paragraph updates automatically on our chosen schedule. So does the "What We Do" page. All automatic. All in our voice. All contextually aware of what's happening in the world.

**It's been Synapsed.**

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Your RSS Feeds │ ← BBC, NYT, TechCrunch, etc.
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   Claude AI     │  ← Your worldview, encoded in prompts
│  Reads + Thinks │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│ Generated Text  │  ← In YOUR voice
│  (2-3 sentences)│
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐

└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Site Serves    │  ← Fresh content on every request
│  Fresh Content  │
└─────────────────┘
```

**On your schedule. Automatically. Forever.**

## What You Get

Everything needed to Synapse your site:

- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow (orchestrates the whole thing)
- ✅ Content generation script (Node.js)
- ✅ System prompt template (encode your thinking)
- ✅ Next.js components (display fresh content)
- ✅ Fallback system (never breaks, even when things fail)
- ✅ Complete documentation (you're reading it)

**Setup time:** 30 minutes
**Monthly cost:** Varies by usage (typically minimal)
**Maintenance:** Zero

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Next.js 14+ site
- GitHub repo
- [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com)
- Any deployment platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

### Installation

**1. Clone this repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RayPrismatica/synapsed-with-love.git
cd synapsed-with-love
```

**2. Copy files to your project**
```bash
# Copy the Synapsed system
cp -r scripts/ YOUR_PROJECT/
cp -r components/ YOUR_PROJECT/
cp -r lib/ YOUR_PROJECT/
cp .github/workflows/generate-content.yml YOUR_PROJECT/.github/workflows/

# Create cache directory
mkdir -p YOUR_PROJECT/data
```

**3. Install dependencies**
```bash
cd YOUR_PROJECT
npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk rss-parser dotenv
```

**4. Set environment variables**

Create `.env.local`:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Add GitHub Secrets (Settings → Secrets → Actions):
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Your API key

**5. Encode your voice**

Edit `scripts/content-generation-prompt.md`:
```markdown
You are [your perspective]. [Your worldview].

Tone:
- [How you sound]
- [What makes you different]

Focus on:
- [What you care about]
- [What others miss]

Examples:
[3-5 samples of your actual writing]
```

**6. Add to your pages**

```tsx
// app/page.tsx
import { getDynamicContent } from '@/lib/getDynamicContent';

export default async function HomePage() {
  const content = await getDynamicContent();

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>{content.newsInsight}</p> {/* ← This is Synapsed */}
    </main>
  );
}
```

**7. Generate first content**

```bash
npm run generate-content
```

**8. Push and deploy**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Synapse this site"
git push
```

**Congratulations. You've been Synapsed.**

GitHub Actions now runs on your schedule. Your site is alive.

## Configuration

### Change Update Frequency

Edit `.github/workflows/generate-content.yml`:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 */6 * * *'    # Every 6 hours (recommended)
  # Other options:
  # - cron: '0 * * * *'     # Hourly
  # - cron: '0 9 * * *'     # Daily at 9 AM
  # - cron: '0 */12 * * *'  # Every 12 hours
```

### Add More RSS Feeds

Edit `scripts/generate-dynamic-content.js`:

```javascript
const feeds = [
  '[INSERT YOUR RSS FEED URLs]',
  // Examples:
  // 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml',
  // 'https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml',
  // 'https://techcrunch.com/feed/',
  // 'https://www.ft.com/rss/home',
  // 'https://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/topNews',
];
```

### Tune Your Voice

The magic lives in `scripts/content-generation-prompt.md`. This is where you encode **how you think**.

**Tips:**
- Be specific ("like texting a friend at 2am" not "casual")
- Show examples (your actual writing, 3-5 samples)
- Define boundaries (topics to avoid, tones to skip)
- Test locally (`npm run generate-content`)
- Iterate until it sounds like you

## System Architecture

### File Structure

```
your-project/
├── .github/workflows/
│   └── generate-content.yml      # The heartbeat
├── scripts/

```

### How Generation Works

**Every 6 hours (or your chosen schedule):**

1. GitHub Actions wakes up
2. Fetches RSS feeds from your configured sources
3. Extracts top headlines
4. Sends to Claude with your prompt
5. Claude generates content in your voice
6. Saves to `data/dynamic-content.json`
7. Site reads cache file on each request
8. Visitors see fresh content

**All automatic. Zero manual work.**

### Triple-Fallback Protection

Your site never breaks, even when things fail:

**Level 1: Generation Failure**
- If Claude API errors → writes safe fallback
- Marks with `fallbackUsed: true`
- Site continues serving content

**Level 2: Cache Miss**
- If cache file missing or too old
- Server returns hardcoded fallback
- Indistinguishable from live content

**Level 3: Component Failure**
- Each component has inline fallback
- Gracefully degrades
- No errors shown to visitors

**Result:** Your site never shows broken content. Ever.

## Content Structure

Synapsed generates two pieces per cycle:

### 1. News Insight (Landing Page)
A sharp 2-3 sentence take on the day's most significant story. Written like you'd text a smart friend.

**Example:**
> "Tesla slashed prices 20% and everyone's panicking about demand collapse. That's not desperation. That's margin testing at scale. Most companies spend millions on focus groups to learn what Elon learns by Tuesday."

### 2. Intelligence Example (Secondary Page)
A callback to the same story, showing how you think about it differently.

**Example:**
> "The Tesla price cuts, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: is this margin testing or demand panic, and what does the timing tell us about Q4 guidance?"

**Both pieces:**
- Reference the same story (coherence)
- Written in your encoded voice
- Under 45 words each
- Zero fluff

## Production Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] Anthropic API key in `.env.local`
- [ ] GitHub Secrets configured
- [ ] System prompt customized
- [ ] Tested locally: `npm run generate-content`
- [ ] Dynamic components added to pages
- [ ] Fallback content updated
- [ ] Workflow file committed
- [ ] First generation successful

Visit GitHub Actions → should see "Generate Dynamic Content" running.

## Monitoring

### Is it working?

**Check GitHub Actions:**
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USER/YOUR_REPO/actions
```
Look for workflow runs on your chosen schedule.

**Check content freshness:**
```bash
# View last generation timestamp
cat data/dynamic-content.json | jq '.generated'

# How old is it?
node -e "console.log((Date.now() - new Date('$(cat data/dynamic-content.json | jq -r .generated)').getTime()) / 60000, 'minutes old')"
```

**Check cache file:**
- Open `data/dynamic-content.json`
- Verify `generated` timestamp is recent
- Check `fallbackUsed` is false

### Common Issues

**Content not updating**
- Check GitHub Actions for errors
- Verify API key is valid
- Test RSS feeds are reachable
- Check cache file permissions

**Seeing fallback content**
- Look for `"fallbackUsed": true` in cache
- Check error in metadata field
- Verify Anthropic account has credits

**Generation working but site not updating**
- Check cache file has fresh timestamp
- Verify site is reading from correct path
- Clear browser cache and retry

## Cost Breakdown

**Anthropic API:**
- 4 generations/day (every 6 hours)
- ~16 headlines analyzed each time
- Claude Opus: $15 per 1M input tokens
- **~$1-3/month** (varies by frequency)

**GitHub Actions:**
- 2,000 free minutes/month
- ~2 minutes per run
- 4 runs/day = ~240 min/month
- **Free** (well within limits)

**Total: ~$1-3/month**

Compare to:
- Content writer: $500+/month
- CMS subscription: $50-500/month
- Your time: Priceless

## Advanced Usage

### Multiple Content Pieces

Generate more fields:

```markdown
# In content-generation-prompt.md

## PIECE 3: Product Insight
[Instructions for additional content]

## PIECE 4: Market Commentary
[Another piece]
```

Update the script to parse them.

### Multiple Pages

Use the same cache everywhere:

```tsx
// Different pages, same cache
const content = await getDynamicContent();

// Landing
<p>{content.newsInsight}</p>

// About
<p>{content.additionalField}</p>

// Services
<p>{content.productInsight}</p>
```

### Industry-Specific Feeds

Add niche RSS sources:

```javascript
// Tech
'https://techcrunch.com/feed/'

// Finance
'https://www.ft.com/?format=rss'

// Marketing
'https://feeds.adweek.com/adweek/digitaleast'
```

### Custom AI Models

Swap Claude for OpenAI, Gemini, etc:

```javascript
// Replace Anthropic SDK
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
});
```

Architecture stays the same.

## Philosophy

### What We're Building

A world where:
- **Thinking is infrastructure** - Available always, never scarce
- **Websites are organisms** - They read, respond, evolve
- **Intelligence compounds** - Sites get smarter over time
- **Small teams compete** - No content team needed

This isn't about replacing human creativity. It's about **multiplying it.**

You think once (encode your voice). The system thinks forever (applies your lens to every news cycle).

### The Bigger Picture

Today, Synapsed updates your landing page.

Tomorrow, it could:
- Write your weekly newsletter
- Generate personalized emails
- Draft social media posts
- Create product descriptions
- Respond to common questions
- Summarize your thinking on any topic

**We're not building a content tool. We're building infrastructure for thought.**

One day, every website will be Synapsed. Static sites will feel as quaint as GeoCities. The question isn't *if* sites will think. It's *whose thinking will they embody.*

We built this so the answer can be: **Yours.**

## FAQ

**Q: Does this work with WordPress/Webflow?**
A: Synapsed is built for git-based deployments (Next.js, Gatsby, Astro). For other platforms, you'd need custom deployment triggers.

**Q: Can I use a different AI?**
A: Yes! Swap the Anthropic SDK for OpenAI, Google, or any API. The architecture is model-agnostic.

**Q: What if I want to edit generated content?**
A: Edit `data/dynamic-content.json` manually. Next generation overwrites it, but you can pause the workflow temporarily.

**Q: Is this SEO-friendly?**
A: Absolutely. Content is server-rendered. Search engines see static HTML. Plus, fresh content helps rankings.

**Q: Can some content stay static?**
A: Yes. Only wrapped components update. Everything else stays as you write it.

**Q: What if Claude generates something wrong?**
A: The prompt has guardrails. You control fallbacks. And you can review changes in GitHub before deploying.

**Q: How do I stop it?**
A: Delete the workflow file or disable it in repo settings. Your site returns to static.

**Q: Is my API key secure?**
A: Yes. Stored in GitHub Secrets, never exposed in code or logs.
